  <!-- Some information About Career -->
  <img src="./img/career2.png" Border="0" height="250" alt="career" title="about career">
  <p align="justify">Career actually has two definitions. The word career is often used to refer to a profession,
    occupation, trade or
    vocation. A career could define what you do for a living and range from those that require extensive training and
    education to those you can perform with only a high school diploma and a willingness to learn. A career could mean
    working as a doctor, lawyer, teacher, carpenter, veterinary assistant, electrician, cashier, teacher or hairstylist.
  </p><br>
  <p>Career has another definition as well, though. It also refers to the progress and actions you have taken throughout
    the working years of your life, especially as they relate to your occupation. It is comprised of the different jobs
    you have held, titles you have earned and work you have accomplished over a long period of time. When viewed in this
    context, a career includes everything related to your career development, including your choice or profession and
    advancement. Your single career could include a variety of different paths.</p><br>
  <h1>What Is the Difference Between a Job and a Career?</h1>
  <img src="./img/job&career.jpg" border="5" alt="Difference">
  <p align="justify">While jobs and careers both enable us to earn enough money to support ourselves and our families,
    they do not mean
    the same thing. It is important to know whether you're looking for a job or for a career to plan your professional
    goals. This article will explain the difference between a job and a career, how one can affect the other and how to
    turn a job into a career.</p><br>
  <h1>What is a job?</h1>
  <p align="justify">A job is work you perform to earn money to support your basic needs. It can be full-time or
    part-time and may be short-term. You might earn an hourly wage or a set paycheck rather than a salary with benefits.
    You might need to learn certain skills connected with that role, but not all jobs require a specialized degree or
    advanced training.</p><br>
  <p>Companies expect their employees to perform their individual jobs in exchange for regular payment and to be
    responsible for the duties laid out for them.</p><br>
  <p>You can also define a job as a short- or long-term contract between an employer and a worker. For instance, a
    company hires a local contractor to complete an office renovation job. They agree upon payment terms, and the job
    ends once the project is complete.</p><br>

  <h1>What is a career?</h1>
  <p>A career is a long-term professional journey you may determine based on your passions. It is the path you embark
    upon to fulfill your professional goals and ambitions. You may require a certain level of education or training to
    achieve these goals. Individuals pursuing careers often have set salaries with benefits such as stock options,
    retirement plans, pensions and bonuses. They also gain benefits beyond money, such as personal pride, work
    satisfaction and self-worth. <br></p>
  <p>A career might last for your entire life. You could hold numerous jobs under many employers in your chosen industry
    that you progress through during your career.</p><br>

  <h1>How does a job affect your career?</h1>
  <p>You will likely hold many jobs throughout your career, even if you don't have a set career path in mind when you
    first join the workforce. It may be helpful to consider every position you fill as a step in your life's work. Your
    job can affect your career in these ways:</p><br>

    allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <h1>Jobs make up your career</h1>
  <img src="./img/job make career.webp" height="200" alt="job make career">
  <p>A career consists of all the jobs you have worked, regardless of whether they are associated with each other. You
    could spend decades working a job in the same department as one organization. Alternatively, you could work many
    seemingly unrelated jobs over your lifetime, such as greenskeeper, executive assistant and information technology
    specialist. They all define your career and can connect you with other opportunities you are passionate about. Think
    of jobs as the short-term duties that can help you achieve your long-term goals.</p><br>
