    <p class="P">theatre, also spelled theater, in dramatic arts, an art concerned almost exclusively with live performances in
        which the action is precisely planned to create a coherent and significant sense of drama.<br><br>

        Though the word theatre is derived from the Greek theaomai, “to see,” the performance itself may appeal either
        to the ear or to the eye, as is suggested by the interchangeability of the terms spectator and audience.
        Sometimes the appeal is strongly intellectual, as in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, but the intellectual element
        in itself is no assurance of good theatre. A good performance of Hamlet,
        for example, is extremely difficult to achieve, and a poor one is much less rewarding than a brilliant
        presentation of a farce. Moreover, a good Hamlet makes demands on the spectator that may be greater than what
        that spectator is prepared to put forward,
        while the farce may be enjoyed in a condition of comparative relaxation. The full participation of the spectator
        is a vital element in theatre.<br><br>
    <h2>Theatre Of India</h2>
    <p class="P">Indian theatre is one of the most ancient forms of theatre and it features a detailed textual, sculptural, and
        dramatic effects which emerged in mid first millennium BC. Like in the areas of music and dance, the Indian
        theatre is also defined by the dramatic performance based on the concept of Natya,
        which is a Sanskrit word for drama but encompasses dramatic narrative, virtuostic dance, and music.Historically,
        Indian theatre has exerted influence beyond its borders, reaching ancient China and other countries in the Far
        East.
        With the Islamic conquests that began in the 10th and 11th centuries, theatre was discouraged or forbidden
        entirely. Later, in an attempt to re-assert indigenous values and ideas, village theatre was encouraged across
        the subcontinent, developing in a large number of regional languages from the 15th to the 19th centuries.
        Modern Indian theatre developed during the period of colonial rule under the British Empire, from the mid-19th
        century until the mid-20th. From the last half of the 19th century, theatres in India experienced a boost in
        numbers and practice. After Indian independence in 1947, theatres spread throughout India as one of the means of
        entertainment.
        As a diverse, multi-cultural nation, the theatre of India cannot be reduced to a single, homogenous trend</p><br>

        <p class="P">Theatre is a genre of performance in which the actor's body is the primary means of expression. It is most
            often entirely non-verbal, but even when speech is included, it is usually secondary to movement.
            Mime Theatre is also actor-centered theatre, where the actor, rather than being only the interpreter of the
            piece, is at the heart of its creation.

            It can vary from a solo performer to a full cast, and from a bare stage to a production employing all the
            arts that belong to the theatre, including lighting, music, sound, costume, makeup, props, and scenic
            design.Unfortunately, some think of mime as a sort of “illegitimate art” whose practitioners bother
            pedestrians and demonstrate cliché illusions. Yes, street mime exists, but it tends to be more
            improvisational and interactive with the audience than theatrical mime.
            Imitators of the style of legendary French mime Marcel Marceau have entertained crowds on sidewalks and in
            public squares worldwide, but Marceau was never a street performer himself.
            He cultivated mime as an art of the stage, and dedicated himself to elevating it to the level of the other
            fine arts, like dance, music, painting, and sculpture.
            Mime Theatre is a genre of theatre as old as theatre itself, and can be as profound, poetic, comic, or
            dramatic as any art of the stage. With its roots in ancient Greece and the Renaissance Commedia dell'Arte,
            it has developed in modern times into a highly-skilled actor's art that requires extensive study of its
            physical techniques and dramatic principles.
            Mime Theatre is a complete art in itself, and those who learn it will find it also enhances their work in
            other performing arts such as verbal theatre, acting for film and television, dance, improv theatre,
            stand-up comedy, and more.

        <p class="P"> play functions as a tool to give reveal to one's thoughts through performance in front of the live
            audience. Writers skillfully feature certain situations to make the audience laugh at funny incidents as
            well as feel pity and fear for unfortunate circumstances or incidents. It enables the audience to
            understand and feel a lot out of less description.
            Also, it is a convenient way to present different characters and their inner thoughts in
            dramas.Moreover, it enables the writers to dramatize the story in a way that events and characters are
            easily brought to life through a theatrical performance.</p><br>
        <H2>Dance</H2>
        <img src="/Deepak's Project/giphy.gif" width="350">
        <P class="P">Dance is an art form where the body moves rhythmically, usually to the
            beat of the music. A simple movement such as walking, clapping in a pattern, to a particular rhythm, can be
            termed as dance. Dance allows you to express your emotions and communicate with the rest of the world. It
            also helps in engaging you; socially, physically, and emotionally all at the same time.
            Every culture has a different dance form associated with it. It was used for varying purposes that reveal
            much about their way of life. It can be an art, or ritual or could be used to tell tales of the past.
            Dance has evolved even before the arrival of a written form of language. There are no written documents or
            artefacts to prove its existence but, archaeological findings like stone carvings, paintings and similar
            objects say dancing is at least 9000 years old India. In ancient times, dance was performed to express
            emotions, moods, or ideas; tell a story; serve religious, political, economic, or social needs.</P><br>
        <h2>music</h2>
        <img src="/Deepak's Project/listening-to-music-dancing.gif" width="350">
        <p class="P">Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Making
            music is the process of putting sounds and tones in an order, often combining them to create a unified
            composition. People who make music creatively organize sounds for a desired result, like a Beethoven
            symphony or one of Duke Ellington's jazz songs. Music is made of sounds, vibrations, and silent moments, and
            it doesn't always have to be pleasant or pretty. It can be used to convey a whole range of experiences,
            environments, and emotions.
            Music includes works played by jazz bands
            jazz bandAlmost every human culture has a tradition of making music. Examples of early instruments like
            flutes and drums have been found dating back thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians used music in religious
            ceremonies. Many other African cultures have traditions related to drumming for important rituals. Today,
            rock and pop musicians tour and perform around the world, singing the songs that made them famous. All of
            these are examples of music.</p><br><br>
